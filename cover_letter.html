            Dear Hiring Manager, <br><br>

            I am a Sophomore Computer Engineering student at the University of California: Santa 
            Barbara, and am applying to your posted position of Software Engineer that was referred to me through the 
            Computer Science mailing list. <br><br>

            I would love to work at ONTRAPORT due to the support and automation it provides to small businesses. As the son of 
            an entrepreneur, I understand the importance of self management and how to tackle convoluted financial and managerial tasks.
            Being part of a team that facilitates transactions to create a prosperous business environment would not be just a bullet 
            point on my resume, but a fulfilling project I would be proud to contribute to. <br><br> 
             
            
            I first found myself attracted to engineering upon participating in the Envision Engineering Program 
            hosted at UC Berkeley, and decided to persue Computer Science at UCSB. During my time at UCSB, I have found a deep 
            passion for Computer Science, in conjuction with creation and innovation. Through my coursework and involvement 
            in extracurriculars, namely the Engineering Student Council, the UCSB Hyperloop team, and Coders SB. <br><br>
            
            I believe that my leadership and technical skills would sponsor my success and growth in this position. 
            I have attached my resume with contact information and hope to hear from you soon. <br><br>
            
            
            Sincerely, <br><br><br>
            
            
            Daniel Gamliel<br>
            
        </p>
