            Dear Appfolio Team, <br><br>

            I am a Sophomore Computer Engineering student at the University of California: Santa 
            Barbara, and am applying to your posted position of Software Engineer that was referred to me through 
            one of your previous summer interns, Danish Vaid. <br><br>
            
            I first found myself drawn to engineering upon participating in the Envision Engineering Program 
            hosted at UC Berkeley, and decided to persue Computer Science at UCSB. During my time at UCSB, I 
            have found a deep passion for Computer Science, Software Engineering, and problem solving. 
            In pursuing my passion I have found great pride in participating in various extracurriculars, 
            namely, the Engineering Student Council, the UCSB Hyperloop team, and Coders SB. <br><br> 
            
            I believe that my leadership and technical skills would sponsor my success and growth in this position. 
            I have attached my resume with contact information and hope to hear from you soon. <br><br>
            
            
            Sincerely, <br><br><br>
            
            
            Daniel Gamliel<br>
            
        </p>
